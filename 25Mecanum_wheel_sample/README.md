#The Wheat Wheel Car Project I Wrote Myself in the Summer of 2024

Introduction: This project has three versions in total.

1. V1: The simplest wheat wheel cart cannot achieve omnidirectional movement using TT motors

2. v2: Using TT motor, adding kinematic inverse solution, can achieve omnidirectional displacement

3. v3: Encoders are used, and various PID and filtering algorithms are added to make the movement of the wheat wheel cart smoother.
